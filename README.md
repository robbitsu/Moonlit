## üåå Acknowledgements

This project draws on imagery and folklore inspired by witches, covens, and magical traditions in **fiction and fantasy**.  

We want to acknowledge and respect real-life pagan, Wiccan, and other spiritual paths.  
Moonlit is made in **good faith as a work of fantasy entertainment**, not as a representation or parody of real-world practices or beliefs.  

Inspired by cozy fantasy, folklore, and community-driven play.

# 🌙 Coven Bot (TBD Name)

A Discord mini-game bot where players roleplay as witches, join covens, and grow their magical power together.  
Designed to be approachable for casual players but deep enough to keep engaged players busy with cooperative rituals, spellcrafting, and seasonal events.

## 🌌 Acknowledgements

This project draws on imagery and folklore inspired by witches, covens, and magical traditions in **fiction and fantasy**.  

We want to acknowledge and respect real-life pagan, Wiccan, and other spiritual paths.  
Moonlit is made in **good faith as a work of fantasy entertainment**, not as a representation or parody of real-world practices or beliefs.  

Inspired by cozy fantasy, folklore, and community-driven play.
